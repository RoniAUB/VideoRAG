      "[05:47.600 --> 05:53.040]  a reconfiguration step which is you can move nine into the empty square. You can move three into\n",
      "[05:53.040 --> 06:00.320]  the empty square, 12 or 15. And that gives us basically four neighbors of that vertex in the graph.\n",
      "[06:01.680 --> 06:07.440]  Okay, and we call this whole graph the reconfiguration graph or the state space if you're more\n",
      "[06:07.440 --> 06:15.440]  comfortable thinking about states, the states of the game. So now given this graph, the reconfiguration\n",
      "[06:15.440 --> 06:21.200]  graph, there are tons of very interesting questions that you can ask about it. There are structural\n",
      "[06:21.200 --> 06:26.960]  questions and there are algorithms to make questions. And these are typically the types of questions\n",
      "[06:26.960 --> 06:35.040]  that we're interested in in this area of combinatorial reconfiguration. So a couple of examples of\n",
      "[06:35.040 --> 06:41.040]  structural questions would be, well, the simplest one would be how big is this reconfiguration graph?\n",
      "[06:41.040 --> 06:48.480]  Right? How many vertices or how many edges? And that's usually not a very hard question to answer\n",
      "[06:48.560 --> 06:54.640]  in terms of upper and lower ones. More interestingly, you could ask, is this reconfiguration graph\n",
      "[06:54.640 --> 07:01.680]  connected? Right? Or is, can I reach any state starting from any other state by a sequence of\n",
      "[07:01.680 --> 07:08.800]  legal moves? And as I told you before, for the 15 puzzle, the reconfiguration graph is definitely\n",
      "[07:08.800 --> 07:15.040]  not connected because there was no way to reverse 14 and 15 in the previous example that I showed\n",
      "[07:15.120 --> 07:20.400]  you and you can easily prove that, by the way. So when it's not connected, another question would be\n",
      "[07:20.400 --> 07:28.880]  how many components does it have? Is there some sort of a nice structure to the components of this graph?\n",
      "[07:30.000 --> 07:35.200]  And then another question would be what is the diameter of the circumfiguration graph or of\n",
      "[07:35.200 --> 07:39.680]  each one of its components? And that's usually a very important question to ask when you're dealing with\n",
      "[07:39.680 --> 07:46.880]  one player games because this could tell you like what would be the worst possible shortest path\n",
      "[07:46.880 --> 07:51.600]  to reach a target configuration or to solve your game, to win your game, for example.\n",
      "[07:52.160 --> 07:58.160]  And in the literature, this is sometimes known as God's number, which would be the diameter of\n",
      "[07:58.160 --> 08:04.400]  the reconfiguration graph. And these are all very interesting, very interesting structural questions\n",
      "[08:04.480 --> 08:11.680]  to ask about this reconfiguration graph. Now on the algorithmic side or the computational side,\n",
      "[08:11.680 --> 08:18.320]  there's the obvious question of if I'm given a starting state and some ending state or target state,\n",
      "[08:18.320 --> 08:23.520]  like in the case of the puzzle game, that I am given some starting state and we know what the\n",
      "[08:23.520 --> 08:29.520]  goal state is. So here one decision problem would be to answer the question whether it's possible to\n",
      "[08:29.600 --> 08:34.320]  get to the target state starting from some initial state that is also given to me.\n",
      "[08:35.840 --> 08:40.320]  So you can decide to solve this problem either as a decision problem or as a search problem,\n",
      "[08:40.320 --> 08:45.920]  which would give you the actual sequence of steps that will take you from a state to the target state.\n",
      "[08:49.760 --> 08:55.520]  Other interesting computational problems is it always possible to go from one configuration to\n",
      "[08:55.600 --> 09:01.200]  any other and this is basically also related to the structural question about connected components.\n",
      "[09:02.400 --> 09:09.120]  And the last question that I will mention, which is also interesting, is how fast can you go\n",
      "[09:09.120 --> 09:13.680]  from one configuration to another? Meaning can you do it in at most case steps?\n",
      "[09:14.560 --> 09:20.400]  There is a question I should wait or no.\n",
      "[09:25.280 --> 09:33.520]  All right. So think about all of these questions that we paused using the simple 15 puzzle game.\n",
      "[09:34.080 --> 09:40.160]  And now we're going to look at a lot of other possible problems where the same\n",
      "[09:40.160 --> 09:45.760]  any configuration graph can be extracted. And we can ask the same set of questions.\n",
      "[09:46.800 --> 09:52.400]  So all of you here are familiar with the case sad problem. So you're given a Boolean formula and\n",
      "[09:52.400 --> 09:58.960]  you want to know if you can satisfy this formula by assigning values to the variables. And we know\n",
      "[09:58.960 --> 10:04.880]  that this is NP complete for K greater than or equal to three. So now how can you transform this\n",
      "[10:04.880 --> 10:10.080]  into a reconfiguration problem? Well, it's very simple. So now you're given a formula\n",
      "[10:11.440 --> 10:16.720]  and you're given two satisfying assignments. So you can think of those satisfying assignments as\n",
      "[10:16.720 --> 10:24.480]  bit vectors. And so now the question that you can ask is can I go from the first satisfying assignment\n",
      "[10:24.480 --> 10:32.800]  as to the next one? By basically flipping one bit at a time, under the condition that I remain\n",
      "[10:32.800 --> 10:39.200]  a satisfying assignment at all times. And notice that without this condition, the problem is trivial.\n",
      "[10:40.880 --> 10:48.080]  So you can basically just flip the bits however you like and reach S from T or T from S. But once\n",
      "[10:48.080 --> 10:54.400]  you add this constraint of you should remain a satisfying assignment, the problem becomes way\n",
      "[10:54.400 --> 11:01.520]  more interesting. And you can think of this problem again as walking in the solution space of the\n",
      "[11:01.600 --> 11:11.520]  given formula of all the satisfying assignment of the formula. All right, so that's the sad reconfiguration\n",
      "[11:11.520 --> 11:20.400]  problem. Let's look at another example. Graph coloring. We all know it. We all love it. You're\n",
      "[11:20.400 --> 11:26.320]  given a graph and some integer K and you are asked whether you can properly take color the\n",
      "[11:26.320 --> 11:30.560]  graph G. And we know again that this is NP complete for K greater than or equal to three.\n",
      "[11:31.120 --> 11:36.800]  How do you transform that into a reconfiguration problem? Well, now you're given a graph,\n",
      "[11:36.800 --> 11:44.000]  you're given two colorings of the graph, alpha and beta. And the question is can you recolor alpha\n",
      "[11:44.000 --> 11:51.040]  to get the to beta? But you need to recolor one vertex at a time and you need to remain a proper\n",
      "[11:51.040 --> 11:58.640]  K coloring throughout. Same idea again leads us to this notion of the reconfiguration space\n",
      "[11:58.640 --> 12:03.360]  where we are looking at the K colorings of the graph and how they are connected\n",
      "[12:04.320 --> 12:09.200]  under this adjacent simulation that we define, which is a single vertex recoloring.\n",
      "[12:11.920 --> 12:17.280]  The final example that I will mention, which will be basically what we will focus on in the rest of\n",
      "[12:17.280 --> 12:23.440]  the talk is token placement. I call it, but as you will all guess, this is the famous independent\n",
      "[12:23.440 --> 12:29.360]  set problem. But we will look at it as a token placement problem because it will be more useful\n",
      "[12:29.360 --> 12:34.080]  for the rest of the talk. So you're given a graph G and an integer K. And the question is,\n",
      "[12:34.080 --> 12:40.640]  can you place K tokens on your graph K black tokens so that no two of these tokens share an edge.\n",
      "[12:40.640 --> 12:46.640]  And of course, we all know that this is an NP complete problem. So how can you transform this\n",
      "[12:46.640 --> 12:52.480]  problem into a reconfiguration problem? Again, now I'm giving a graph two independent sets of the graph.\n",
      "[12:54.160 --> 12:58.800]  Each of size K. And the question is, can I go from one independent set to the other\n",
      "[13:00.320 --> 13:07.440]  under what rule? So here defining the rule for independent set, how can I go between consecutive\n",
      "[13:07.440 --> 13:14.160]  independent sets becomes a little bit less obvious. And there are two main strategies that people\n",
      "[13:14.160 --> 13:21.040]  have attempted. So the first rule is what we call token jumping. So you are basically allowed to\n",
      "[13:21.040 --> 13:27.760]  take any token on your graph and jump it to any other vertex on the graph, assuming that it doesn't\n",
      "[13:27.760 --> 13:35.760]  have a token and that you maintain an independent set at all times. So for example, in this example that\n",
      "[13:35.760 --> 13:41.840]  I have here, it would be perfectly okay to take this token here and jump it to this vertex here.\n",
      "[13:41.840 --> 13:52.080]  Or I could also take this token here and jump it to this vertex here. So that, no, actually that\n",
      "[13:52.080 --> 13:59.280]  would violate the independence. So you can jump to any other vertex as long as you maintain independence.\n",
      "[13:59.280 --> 14:06.720]  And we call that the token jumping rule. The other rule is basically token sliding. So in this case,\n",
      "[14:06.720 --> 14:15.920]  we only allow a token to slide along edges of the graph. So a token can only move to adjacent\n",
      "[14:15.920 --> 14:22.560]  vertex, assuming of course, this does not violate independence. So now we have two different\n",
      "[14:22.560 --> 14:27.360]  reconfiguration graphs we can think about. We can think about the reconfiguration graph under the\n",
      "[14:27.360 --> 14:32.800]  token jumping adjacency. And we can think about the reconfiguration graph under the token sliding\n",
      "[14:32.800 --> 14:39.120]  adjacency. And we're going to talk about these two different problems because they do actually\n",
      "[14:39.120 --> 14:46.000]  behave quite differently and they produce quite interesting results like the difference between the two.\n",
      "[14:46.000 --> 14:51.840]  We don't fully understand yet, but we kind of know that token sliding can be harder than token\n",
      "[14:51.840 --> 15:00.560]  jumping. But there's still a lot of questions to be answered. All right. So some of you might be asking,\n",
      "[15:00.560 --> 15:08.480]  why do we care about studying such problems? There's a lot of motivations out there. I mean,\n",
      "[15:09.600 --> 15:15.120]  sometimes I would say you don't need motivation. They're interesting. There's a lot of open\n",
      "[15:15.120 --> 15:20.720]  questions that we need to answer. But you can also think about reconfiguration problems as another\n",
      "[15:20.720 --> 15:26.560]  way of modeling real world algorithmic problems because you usually never start from scratch.\n",
      "[15:27.120 --> 15:32.080]  When you're trying to solve real world problems, you usually start from something and you're trying\n",
      "[15:32.080 --> 15:37.760]  to prove it or make it better or change it to something more appropriate. Another very good\n",
      "[15:38.640 --> 15:44.720]  application of studying these problems is that they give you a better understanding of solution\n",
      "[15:44.720 --> 15:50.960]  spaces, which can be very important for other areas as well. And they have been used in statistical\n",
      "[15:50.960 --> 15:57.520]  physics, quantum computing, any complexity theory, combinatorics, and robotics, and hopefully many more\n",
      "[15:57.520 --> 16:03.200]  applications to come. But what I would tell you is that there are so many very interesting problems\n",
      "[16:03.200 --> 16:08.800]  that are so easy to start thinking about without having too much background, which is what I think\n",
      "[16:08.800 --> 16:15.120]  this is a very nice area to start working on at any level in your research career.\n",
      "[16:15.200 --> 16:25.200]  All right, so I'll take a break here and take questions if there are any. And then we will dive into\n",
      "[16:25.200 --> 16:32.640]  the token jumping and token sliding problems, what we know about them in terms of classical complexity,\n",
      "[16:32.640 --> 16:37.280]  and what was basically the starting point for the project that led us to this paper.\n",
      "[16:37.760 --> 16:41.920]  Any questions at this point?\n",
      "[16:45.200 --> 16:51.600]  I'm, I apologize for the small context, which I am in interrupting here. So this is just to\n",
      "[16:51.600 --> 16:57.680]  announce for the PC301 workshop that will be happening in December end. And this will be slightly\n",
      "[16:57.680 --> 17:03.120]  different from the previous two workshops. First major difference, this will be online. Second is\n",
      "[17:03.760 --> 17:11.840]  some advanced topics, what we discuss. So anyone who intends to explore somewhat more complex\n",
      "[17:11.840 --> 17:18.480]  topics in parametrize algorithms is invited to have a check. They can look at the website that\n",
      "[17:18.480 --> 17:23.200]  has been shared on the chat. And if you wish, you can register simply by filling a form that is\n",
      "[17:24.400 --> 17:30.480]  linked at the bottom of the webpage. So just to inform you all about it. And sorry for the\n",
      "[17:30.480 --> 17:42.000]  introduction for this now. All right. All right. So let's start talking about token jumping,\n",
      "[17:42.000 --> 17:48.080]  token sliding, and a little bit about classical complexity. I know everybody here knows about\n",
      "[17:48.080 --> 17:53.120]  P and NPs. So I'm not going to talk about this. Some of you might not be familiar with the\n",
      "[17:53.120 --> 17:59.520]  P space class. So just a quick note that's as much as you will need to know for this talk is that\n",
      "[17:59.520 --> 18:05.840]  P space is the set of all decision problems that can be solved using a polynomial amount of space.\n",
      "[18:06.720 --> 18:13.360]  And the reason why I mentioned this class is because many many many many the configuration problem\n",
      "[18:13.360 --> 18:20.400]  actually are P space complete. Okay. And so so what we know the standard inclusion is we know that\n",
      "[18:20.400 --> 18:26.480]  P is contained in NP, which is contained in P space. But a very useful thing about P space is\n",
      "[18:26.480 --> 18:34.080]  that savage prove that it's equal to NP space. So polynomial space and non deterministic polynomial\n",
      "[18:34.080 --> 18:41.040]  space are the same class. Basically, and that's extremely useful when you start to think about\n",
      "[18:41.040 --> 18:45.760]  reconfiguration problems because if you think about reconfiguration problem where you're given some\n",
      "[18:45.760 --> 18:53.520]  state and you want to reach the other one. So basically you can solve that easily and non deterministic\n",
      "[18:53.520 --> 19:02.400]  polynomial space, which basically implies that they are NP space. But actually you can show a lot\n",
      "[19:02.400 --> 19:08.160]  more than that. You can show that many really many reconfiguration problems are actually P space\n",
      "[19:08.160 --> 19:13.760]  complete, which is not surprising. Right. The fact that many of these reconfiguration problems are\n",
      "[19:13.760 --> 19:22.640]  P space complete is not very surprising. Right. And then not being in NP is because they don't always\n",
      "[19:22.640 --> 19:28.560]  have polynomial size certificates, which also makes sense because sometimes the number of steps\n",
      "[19:28.560 --> 19:34.080]  that you need to take to go from one configuration to the other might very well be exponential in the\n",
      "[19:34.080 --> 19:41.120]  graph. But there are also some extremely surprising results. And these are some of the results some of\n",
      "[19:41.120 --> 19:48.640]  my favorite results in the area. So for example, you all know that coloring is NP complete even for\n",
      "[19:48.880 --> 19:56.320]  K equals three. However, it turns out that if you try to solve the recoloring problem for K equals\n",
      "[19:56.320 --> 20:02.640]  three, it's actually polynomial time solvable. So if I give you two three colorings of a graph and\n",
      "[20:02.640 --> 20:09.680]  I ask you, is there a path between them that recolors one vertex at a time and never is and is\n",
      "[20:09.680 --> 20:15.840]  always a valid three coloring, then this problem can be solved in polynomial time. And the recoloring\n",
      "[20:15.840 --> 20:23.600]  problem only becomes P space complete for K equals four and more. Right. So that's the first\n",
      "[20:24.480 --> 20:31.760]  surprising result. Another very surprising result is that as as your all FBT experts here, I know\n",
      "[20:31.760 --> 20:37.440]  that you're all familiar with the fact that usually when we study problems on graphs of bounded bucket\n",
      "[20:37.760 --> 20:46.080]  path with tree width, they tend to become easier. It turns out that that's not really the case\n",
      "[20:46.800 --> 20:51.360]  for reconfiguration problems, at least for token sliding and jumping, which is the two problems\n",
      "[20:51.360 --> 20:57.280]  that are related to independent set. It turns out that those two problems remain P space complete\n",
      "[20:57.280 --> 21:03.440]  even if you have a graph of constant tree width or path width or even bucket width. So a very,\n",
      "[21:03.440 --> 21:08.640]  very, very simple graph structure still the problem remains hard.\n",
      "[21:11.120 --> 21:18.560]  All right. And finally, the last theorem that I also like a lot shows you basically that\n",
      "[21:18.560 --> 21:26.160]  sliding and jumping behave differently. And it was shown that if you restrict yourself to\n",
      "[21:26.160 --> 21:31.440]  bipartite graphs, where we know that max and independent set can be solved in polynomial time,\n",
      "[21:32.240 --> 21:38.560]  if you restrict yourself to those graphs, it turns out that token jumping is NP complete,\n",
      "[21:39.760 --> 21:46.400]  whereas token sliding is P space complete, which is a which is a strange\n",
      "[21:48.480 --> 21:50.880]  difference between the behavior of those two problems.\n",
      "[21:54.240 --> 21:54.640]  All right.\n",
      "[21:55.120 --> 22:04.080]  So in fact, we know a lot more about token sliding and token jumping. These problems have been\n",
      "[22:04.080 --> 22:08.960]  at the heart of the area of combinatorial reconfiguration. They have been studied so much.\n",
      "[22:09.920 --> 22:15.120]  And we know so much about them at least in terms of standard or classical complexity.\n",
      "[22:15.680 --> 22:22.160]  So some of the important results for our paper that we're going to focus on\n",
      "[22:22.880 --> 22:30.080]  is this result. So that's going to be the starting point of the results that we will discuss\n",
      "[22:30.080 --> 22:35.040]  next when we move to parametrize complexity. So the fact that token sliding and token jumping\n",
      "[22:36.640 --> 22:41.520]  are b space complete and then NP complete respectively on bipartite graphs was the starting\n",
      "[22:41.520 --> 22:46.320]  point of our next paper. But there are some very interesting results here that are also worth\n",
      "[22:46.320 --> 22:51.600]  mentioning. So for example, for even whole figure halves, we know how to solve token jumping\n",
      "[22:51.600 --> 22:58.240]  in polynomial time. But the complexity of independent set even remains open on this class of graphs.\n",
      "[22:59.600 --> 23:05.360]  And the complexity of token sliding also remains open. So we don't know how to check if given\n",
      "[23:05.360 --> 23:11.440]  two independent sets, I can slide one to the other. Can you answer that question in polynomial\n",
      "[23:11.440 --> 23:18.880]  time for even whole free graphs? For split graphs and chordal graphs, they also behave\n",
      "[23:18.880 --> 23:24.320]  extremely differently token sliding and token jumping. So they are token sliding is p space\n",
      "[23:24.320 --> 23:29.600]  complete on split graphs and chordal graphs while token jumping is polynomial time.\n",
      "[23:30.800 --> 23:38.160]  And that is some of the reasons why we feel that token sliding is harder usually than token jumping.\n",
      "[23:38.160 --> 23:48.480]  But it's not always the case. All right. So that's it for classical complexity.\n",
      "[23:49.840 --> 23:55.920]  So now let's move on to parameterized complexity. And let's basically think about how you can\n",
      "[23:55.920 --> 24:04.080]  parameterize those two problems, token jumping and token sliding. So the obvious parameter would be\n",
      "[24:04.080 --> 24:09.280]  the number of tokens. So one of the obvious parameters would be the number of tokens. So\n",
      "[24:10.320 --> 24:15.440]  and we're going to denote that by K. Another parameter would be the length of the sequence.\n",
      "[24:15.440 --> 24:20.000]  Like how many steps does it take to go from one independent set to the other?\n",
      "[24:20.880 --> 24:25.600]  You can also obviously parameterize by tree width or path width or any combination of the above.\n",
      "[24:26.880 --> 24:34.080]  When we started working on this problem, our initial aim was to basically study the\n",
      "[24:34.080 --> 24:40.160]  parameterized complexity of token sliding and token jumping on bipartite graphs using the parameter\n",
      "[24:40.160 --> 24:46.320]  K number of tokens. Right? Because remember, we saw that token sliding is piece-based\n",
      "[24:46.320 --> 24:53.120]  complete on bipartite graphs and token jumping is NP. So you were interested to see if basically\n",
      "[24:53.120 --> 24:59.120]  this is going to give us W1 hardness for token sliding and FPTNES for token jumping.\n",
      "[25:00.800 --> 25:05.440]  All right. At least that was the initial hope. That's why we started working on this project.\n",
      "[25:06.160 --> 25:12.000]  We weren't able to answer the two questions. So we were able to answer one side of the question,\n",
      "[25:12.720 --> 25:20.720]  which is we were able to show that on bipartite graphs, token sliding is in fact W1 hardness.\n",
      "[25:22.320 --> 25:28.160]  So token sliding parameterized by the number of tokens on bipartite graphs is W1 hard.\n",
      "[25:28.720 --> 25:35.120]  We were not able to answer the question for token jumping. So that is still an open question.\n",
      "[25:36.000 --> 25:42.800]  So having answered that question and failed on the next question, we started thinking about ways\n",
      "[25:42.800 --> 25:49.760]  to basically simplify a little bit some of these questions. So the next thing we asked ourselves,\n",
      "[25:49.760 --> 25:56.320]  so there are two directions where you can try and simplify. So the next thing we asked\n",
      "[25:56.320 --> 26:02.480]  ourselves was, okay, so from bipartite graphs, how can I go to other classes of graphs\n",
      "[26:03.200 --> 26:11.200]  and see where token jumping becomes hard or easy? And it turned out that if you basically exclude\n",
      "[26:11.200 --> 26:21.120]  only C4 from your graph, right? And so we, because in bipartite graphs, you're excluding all odd cycles.\n",
      "[26:22.640 --> 26:28.160]  Right. So, and we started thinking about what kinds of cycles affect the behavior of those\n",
      "[26:28.160 --> 26:33.520]  problems? So the first question was, what about C4 free graphs? And it turned out that both\n",
      "[26:33.520 --> 26:42.720]  problems remained W1 hard on C4 free graphs. Now, if you exclude C3 and C4, it turns out that\n",
      "[26:42.720 --> 26:49.920]  token jumping becomes FPD has an order K squared kernel. But for token sliding, we were not able\n",
      "[26:50.560 --> 26:57.760]  to determine the complexity. Now, if you go to the other side of that,\n",
      "[26:58.400 --> 27:07.280]  so what if we enforce both bipartiteness as well as C4 freeness? So in that case, we were able to\n",
      "[27:07.280 --> 27:16.880]  show that both problems became FPD. Okay. And basically, the bipartite bounded degree graphs was\n",
      "[27:16.880 --> 27:25.200]  just a stepping stone to get to the bipartite C4 free graph result. So let me, let me repeat that\n",
      "[27:25.200 --> 27:30.880]  maybe slightly more clearly. So after basically answering the first question, which was bipartite\n",
      "[27:30.880 --> 27:36.160]  graphs, we were able to show that token sliding was W1 hard, but we were not able to determine\n",
      "[27:36.160 --> 27:43.120]  the complexity of token jumping. So then we went to C4 free graphs and we were able to show that both\n",
      "[27:43.120 --> 27:50.640]  problems are actually W1 hard. Then if we added one more constraint, which was C3 C4 free graphs,\n",
      "[27:50.640 --> 27:55.280]  we got FPDness for token jumping, but it remained open for token sliding.\n",
      "[27:56.400 --> 28:02.960]  And on the other side of the spectrum, so if we keep bipartite and enforce the C4 freeness,\n",
      "[28:02.960 --> 28:13.760]  we get FPD for both problems. And as a side note, this blue result is not part of our paper. This\n",
      "[28:13.760 --> 28:22.880]  was known prior to our paper. So any questions about the results?\n",
      "[28:22.880 --> 28:49.200]  No questions. All right. Cool. So lots of open problems. The first and obvious one is,\n",
      "[28:49.840 --> 28:54.640]  what is the pattern is token jumping FPD, parameterized by K on bipartite graphs.\n",
      "[28:55.280 --> 29:01.360]  And that's really, I mean, that was the initial question that we set out to answer and couldn't.\n",
      "[29:01.360 --> 29:12.640]  So that remains open. And it's, so I will not be going over the hardness reduction for token sliding\n",
      "[29:12.640 --> 29:18.320]  on bipartite graphs because it's quite technical. I don't feel a talk is the right place to go over it.\n",
      "[29:19.520 --> 29:27.120]  But if you go over the reduction, you will see that that it's the two problems really behave\n",
      "[29:27.120 --> 29:32.240]  differently. And there that doesn't seem to be a chance to basically make the same type of\n",
      "[29:32.240 --> 29:39.920]  reduction work for token jumping. So the second interesting open question is, how about token jumping\n",
      "[29:39.920 --> 29:45.920]  parameterized by K on triangle free graphs? That's basically even more general than question one.\n",
      "[29:46.880 --> 29:53.360]  Right. So, and the reason why I mentioned this question separately is because almost every reduction\n",
      "[29:53.360 --> 30:01.280]  that I know of includes large clicks. So you need to use large clicks in your reductions. So how about\n",
      "[30:01.280 --> 30:08.080]  if we don't allow triangle and large clicks? So can we can we can we then say something about the problem?\n",
      "[30:08.960 --> 30:16.320]  So that's for token jumping. Now, when it when you go to token sliding. So, so the open problem is\n",
      "[30:17.280 --> 30:23.520]  what happens for token sliding on graphs of girth at least five, so if they are C3, C4 free.\n",
      "[30:24.240 --> 30:31.440]  Or you can even make that a bit weaker and ask for any girth of at least P for some constant P.\n",
      "[30:33.840 --> 30:37.200]  And for all of these questions, of course, polynomial kernels.\n",
      "[30:38.560 --> 30:44.800]  Would be interesting as well because in our case, we do get polynomial kernels for the FB.\n",
      "[30:47.600 --> 30:53.360]  And the polynomials are not great, but polynomial regardless.\n",
      "[30:56.640 --> 31:03.680]  All right. So, in the rest of the talk, I will try to cover some of the technical stuff.\n",
      "[31:03.680 --> 31:09.360]  And as promised, I will try to keep it as light as possible so that I can give you some of a lot\n",
      "[31:09.360 --> 31:15.920]  of the intuition and techniques that are used in this paper and that are generally used when\n",
      "[31:15.920 --> 31:22.160]  dealing with reconfiguration problems. So the first result that we will go over is this W hardness\n",
      "[31:22.160 --> 31:28.560]  on C4 free graphs. Right. For both token sliding and token jumping. It's the same reduction and\n",
      "[31:29.520 --> 31:35.600]  you will get both results because we will be using maximum independent sets.\n",
      "[31:36.480 --> 31:43.120]  So if you're trying to basically do token sliding from one maximum independent set to the other,\n",
      "[31:43.760 --> 31:48.880]  or token jumping, these two rules become equivalent. Jumping becomes equivalent to sliding.\n",
      "[31:49.520 --> 31:54.400]  So when you're dealing with maximum independent sets, these two basically rules are the same.\n",
      "[31:55.360 --> 31:59.440]  And that's what we're going to do. But what we're going to prove actually is a stronger\n",
      "[31:59.440 --> 32:05.200]  theorem. What we're going to prove is the following theorem. If you take any p greater than or\n",
      "[32:05.200 --> 32:15.200]  equal to four, then both problems are W hard on C4, C5 dot dot dot up to CP free graphs,\n",
      "[32:15.920 --> 32:27.120]  which implies of course C4 free graphs. But you can basically exclude any cycles from C4 up to CP\n",
      "[32:27.120 --> 32:30.640]  for constant P and the problems will remain W1 hard.\n",
      "[32:36.960 --> 32:43.520]  So how do we prove this result? In fact, we use a known reduction from a problem known as grid\n",
      "[32:43.520 --> 32:51.440]  tiling, which is a W1 hard problem. And grid tiling is reduced to the independent set problem\n",
      "[32:51.440 --> 33:00.320]  on C4 up to CP free graphs. And that reduction was used to show that independent set remains\n",
      "[33:00.320 --> 33:09.360]  W1 hard if you exclude C4 up to CP for any constant P. But what is interesting and useful in that\n",
      "[33:09.360 --> 33:16.160]  reduction is the graph that is obtained from the reduction. So the graph that is obtained from\n",
      "[33:16.160 --> 33:22.640]  the reduction has three properties that are going to be useful to us. The first property is that\n",
      "[33:22.640 --> 33:31.680]  you can partition the graph into basically 8k squared into P plus 1 clicks. So you have a bunch of\n",
      "[33:31.680 --> 33:36.880]  clicks each of size n and all of the edges basically are between the clicks.\n",
      "[33:38.960 --> 33:44.560]  But that's it, that's it, that's the whole of the graph. It's a bunch of clicks and edges between them.\n",
      "[33:45.680 --> 33:52.480]  Of course, the more important property as well here is that this graph is going to be C4 up to CP free.\n",
      "[33:52.880 --> 34:03.040]  It will not have any of those cycles as an induced sub graph. And it's an equivalent instance to\n",
      "[34:03.040 --> 34:11.200]  the grid tiling. And that basically gives you a W1 hardness of independent set on this class of graphs.\n",
      "[34:13.360 --> 34:19.600]  So notice in this case that an independent set of size 8k squared into P plus 1 will have to\n",
      "[34:19.600 --> 34:23.760]  be a maximum independent set because that's how many clicks we get in the resulting graph.\n",
      "[34:24.480 --> 34:29.920]  And that's basically the sizes that we will be working with, more or less up to some modifications.\n",
      "[34:30.400 --> 34:38.080]  But this will allow us to basically conclude that both sliding and jumping are hard on this class of\n",
      "[34:38.080 --> 34:48.480]  graphs. So how do we use this for showing hardness of token sliding and token jumping? And let's\n",
      "[34:48.480 --> 34:54.480]  focus on token sliding for now because it's going to be the same anyway. So we have those clicks\n",
      "[34:55.040 --> 35:02.080]  and some edges that go between the clicks. So the first attempt would be as follows. We will add\n",
      "[35:02.800 --> 35:08.640]  a universal vertex to each one of the clicks and we will call this the starting set or the starting\n",
      "[35:08.640 --> 35:14.560]  independent set. And then we add another universal vertex to each one of the clicks and call this\n",
      "[35:14.640 --> 35:20.400]  the target independent set. And now basically we have our instance of token sliding. We want to\n",
      "[35:20.400 --> 35:30.160]  slide everybody in S down to T. So notice that this is useful because we don't introduce any of the\n",
      "[35:30.160 --> 35:37.680]  forbidden cycles. So we are still fine. And if we could guarantee that all of the tokens\n",
      "[35:37.680 --> 35:44.480]  will be on the on the clicks simultaneously, then this will imply an independent set in the\n",
      "[35:44.480 --> 35:50.800]  original graph, which concludes our proof. But unfortunately in this case, we definitely cannot\n",
      "[35:50.800 --> 35:58.640]  conclude that because each rent token can slide independently here and then here and then the\n",
      "[35:58.640 --> 36:05.040]  next one can follow, etc, etc, etc. So you need some way of forbidden, are forbidding\n",
      "[36:06.000 --> 36:14.400]  the tokens to behave freely. We want to make sure that they will all be inside the clicks simultaneously\n",
      "[36:14.400 --> 36:19.760]  and we will be done. And notice that we're going to have 8k squared and 2p plus 1 tokens, right?\n",
      "[36:19.760 --> 36:27.200]  1 for each click and 2 universal vertices for each click. So how do we fix this time of 1080\n",
      "[36:27.760 --> 36:35.760]  issue? Well, here's how we can do it. So instead of simply adding universal vertices,\n",
      "[36:36.560 --> 36:42.240]  we're also going to add an edge between every two universal vertices of a click. And then we're\n",
      "[36:42.240 --> 36:49.600]  going to add something that we call a switch. And in this case, it's a simple edge. And the red token\n",
      "[36:50.160 --> 36:57.440]  needs to go to the blue position. Right? So now we have one extra token inside our graph.\n",
      "[36:57.440 --> 37:08.400]  But now notice what happens. If any red token wants to come to the blue position, then this red token\n",
      "[37:08.400 --> 37:14.720]  needs to be moved to this position before. And if you move that token up to the blue position,\n",
      "[37:14.800 --> 37:20.320]  then you can no longer have any of the red tokens on the universal vertices, which means that they\n",
      "[37:20.320 --> 37:27.360]  will all have to be simultaneously inside the clicks. And now we get the behavior that we want.\n",
      "[37:29.360 --> 37:34.560]  So now we can guarantee that if there is a sequence that takes the red tokens to the blue position,\n",
      "[37:36.000 --> 37:43.040]  then somewhere along that sequence, the tokens are all going to be within the clicks. Unfortunately,\n",
      "[37:43.040 --> 37:48.720]  what happened here is we might have introduced some of the forbidden cycles. We can no longer\n",
      "[37:48.720 --> 37:56.960]  guarantee that this is C4 up to CP3. So what you can do in this case to solve this problem,\n",
      "[37:56.960 --> 38:02.720]  and I'm not going to go into the details, but the intuition should be pretty clear, is that you can\n",
      "[38:02.720 --> 38:09.280]  subdivide those edges, make them long enough so that you don't introduce any forbidden cycles,\n",
      "[38:09.360 --> 38:13.040]  and add appropriate tokens inside of them to get the same behavior.\n",
      "[38:15.200 --> 38:19.760]  Because notice that the number of such edges is bounded by a function of K,\n",
      "[38:20.640 --> 38:24.400]  by a function of yes K and P. This case.\n",
      "[38:26.240 --> 38:33.040]  Right, so you can make these edges subdivide them as many times as needed, add as many tokens\n",
      "[38:33.040 --> 38:37.920]  as needed to maintain all the properties that we need, and to maintain that we're going from one\n",
      "[38:37.920 --> 38:44.720]  maximum independent set to the other, which will give you W1 hardness for both token sliding as well\n",
      "[38:44.720 --> 38:55.200]  as token jumping. All right, questions?\n",
      "[38:55.360 --> 39:10.720]  No questions? All right, so let's keep going.\n",
      "[39:13.680 --> 39:17.600]  So now I'm going to talk about some positive result.\n",
      "[39:18.000 --> 39:23.040]  So the result that I'm going to talk about is this one here.\n",
      "[39:23.920 --> 39:33.120]  Right, so I'm going to show you that on C3, C4 free graphs, token jumping is actually FPD and has\n",
      "[39:33.120 --> 39:38.400]  a quadratic kernel, but again, what we will show is a stronger result.\n",
      "[39:39.360 --> 39:48.880]  So what we will show is the following theorem. What we will show is can be summarized as follows.\n",
      "[39:48.880 --> 39:55.440]  So if you look at any graph or at any instance of the token jumping problem.\n",
      "[39:55.440 --> 40:00.800]  So remember, an instance of token jumping has the input graph, the starting set, the target set,\n",
      "[40:00.800 --> 40:09.920]  and K as the number of tokens. So let me try and draw something here. So if you look at\n",
      "[40:11.040 --> 40:16.160]  your graph, you can kind of decompose it into something which is more or less as follows.\n",
      "[40:17.120 --> 40:21.760]  So you have S, you have T, the intersection need not be empty,\n",
      "[40:23.280 --> 40:26.640]  and then you have the neighborhood of S union T,\n",
      "[40:26.800 --> 40:30.480]  and then you have the rest of the graph.\n",
      "[40:33.040 --> 40:39.360]  So we're going to call the rest of the graph H, and we're going to call the close neighborhood\n",
      "[40:39.360 --> 40:46.320]  of S union D, or if you will, this yellow part here, we call that J.\n",
      "[40:47.120 --> 40:52.080]  Right, so we can think of our problem of our graph as being decomposed into those two areas.\n",
      "[40:52.640 --> 40:58.560]  H and J. Okay, so the theorem states the following.\n",
      "[40:59.520 --> 41:06.480]  If H is epsilon sparse, where epsilon sparse means that the number of edges is at most\n",
      "[41:06.480 --> 41:15.680]  n squared minus epsilon, positive epsilon. So if H is epsilon sparse, and J is C3C for free,\n",
      "[41:16.480 --> 41:24.400]  then the problem admits a kernel, which is that big, K squared plus K into 1 plus 1 over epsilon.\n",
      "[41:25.280 --> 41:34.640]  So notice now that we only need that H is epsilon sparse, and we only require C3C for\n",
      "[41:34.720 --> 41:41.360]  freeness inside J, which is S union T close neighborhood of S union T.\n",
      "[41:45.120 --> 41:50.320]  And this idea is actually is not a new idea. So this idea is,\n",
      "[41:51.600 --> 41:55.920]  okay, I had the drawing here, I should have used it. So the idea comes from,\n",
      "[41:55.920 --> 42:02.160]  from has been used before, and it's what we call the buffer technique for the token jumping problem.\n",
      "[42:02.240 --> 42:08.880]  And the intuition behind the buffer technique is very simple. So if I have S union T, but somewhere\n",
      "[42:09.760 --> 42:15.120]  in the graph, which is not in the close neighborhood of S union T, I have a case sized\n",
      "[42:15.120 --> 42:21.360]  independent set, then you are done. Right, if I have a case sized independent set in H,\n",
      "[42:22.880 --> 42:28.720]  then you're done. You can basically take all the tokens on S, jump them into those\n",
      "[42:29.360 --> 42:32.960]  independent yellow vertices in H, and then jump them back to T.\n",
      "[42:34.480 --> 42:39.120]  So in some sense, when H has a large independent set, that's the easy case.\n",
      "[42:40.880 --> 42:44.960]  Right, you're done. If you can find a large enough independent set in H, you're done.\n",
      "[42:46.240 --> 42:50.960]  And that's what we call the buffer technique, because it's been also used to show that the problem\n",
      "[42:50.960 --> 42:58.160]  is FBT on planar graphs, for example, or K3J free graphs. So graphs without large bi-clips.\n",
      "[42:59.280 --> 43:12.720]  So it's a well-known technique. All right. So what do we show? So we're going to use the buffer technique,\n",
      "[43:12.720 --> 43:20.480]  and we're going to combine it with something else. So we show that you have a yes instance\n",
      "[43:21.440 --> 43:29.760]  whenever one of those two conditions is true. The first condition is that H is epsilon sparse and\n",
      "[43:29.760 --> 43:38.320]  contains more than this many vertices. And this is relatively easy. When you contain this\n",
      "[43:38.320 --> 43:43.680]  many vertices and you add epsilon sparse, then you will have a case size independent set.\n",
      "[43:43.680 --> 43:49.440]  And that's basically the buffer technique. When H is epsilon sparse and has that many vertices\n",
      "[43:49.440 --> 43:54.000]  or more, then H is guaranteed to have an independent set of sparse and you're done.\n",
      "[43:55.520 --> 44:02.000]  So now you are stuck with what happens inside J, or the closed neighborhood of S-Union T.\n",
      "[44:02.560 --> 44:09.920]  And it turns out there, if you have C3C for freeness, the only thing you need on top of that,\n",
      "[44:09.920 --> 44:14.080]  to guarantee a yes instance, is a vertex of degree at least 3K.\n",
      "[44:14.560 --> 44:24.880]  So if you have C3C for freeness inside J, and the vertex of degree 3K, then again you get a yes instance.\n",
      "[44:24.880 --> 44:34.880]  So let me prove those two statements separately, because they will be basically what we need for the\n",
      "[44:34.880 --> 44:44.000]  final theorem for the final theorem. So the first lemma, as I told you, if H is epsilon sparse and\n",
      "[44:44.000 --> 44:49.600]  has more than this many vertices, then it's a yes instance, because you have a case size\n",
      "[44:49.600 --> 44:55.440]  independent set in H. The idea of this proof is simple. It's a counting argument.\n",
      "[44:56.160 --> 45:01.360]  And what you need to do basically first is to show that H must contain a vertex of degree\n",
      "[45:01.360 --> 45:07.920]  less than and over K. And then basically you apply the standard greedy packing algorithm for\n",
      "[45:07.920 --> 45:13.600]  constructing an independent set of size K. And the reason you show that the way you show that H\n",
      "[45:13.600 --> 45:19.920]  has a vertex of degree less than and over K is, again, standard counting argument and the\n",
      "[45:19.920 --> 45:26.480]  hand-shaking lemma. So if the minimum degree in H was at least n over K, then the number of edges\n",
      "[45:26.480 --> 45:34.880]  would be at least n squared over 2K, which will only happen in an epsilon sparse graph when n is\n",
      "[45:34.880 --> 45:43.120]  less than or equal 2K to the power 1 over S. And the rest of the proof is basically an induction on K.\n",
      "[45:45.200 --> 45:50.160]  Okay, and so that shows you that when you do have an epsilon sparse graph with more than\n",
      "[45:50.800 --> 46:00.480]  this many vertices, then we have a yes instance. All right, so how about the second part of the claim?\n",
      "[46:00.480 --> 46:07.920]  So now what happens if we have a C3 C4 free J that has a vertex of degree 3K? Well, let's see what\n",
      "[46:07.920 --> 46:16.720]  happens. So if we have a vertex of degree 3K and I'm going to circle it here in yellow. So how can\n",
      "[46:16.720 --> 46:22.960]  the neighborhood of that vertex look? Well, we know that J is C3 free. So the blue edges cannot\n",
      "[46:22.960 --> 46:28.960]  exist, which means that the neighborhood of the yellow vertex is an independent set inside J,\n",
      "[46:30.800 --> 46:37.680]  not in the whole graph. Well, in fact, in the whole well known because we're only talking about J\n",
      "[46:37.680 --> 46:44.960]  as a subgratio. Right, so the blue edges cannot exist because otherwise we will get a C3 inside J.\n",
      "[46:46.960 --> 46:57.600]  All right, so now let's look at the other vertices in S union T. The other, the second observation\n",
      "[46:57.600 --> 47:04.080]  that you need is that any vertex other than the yellow vertex can have at most one neighbor in\n",
      "[47:04.080 --> 47:11.600]  common with the yellow vertex. Because if you do have two neighbors in common, then you will get a C4.\n",
      "[47:11.680 --> 47:21.760]  So now what happens if we have three k vertices in the neighborhood of the yellow vertex? Well,\n",
      "[47:22.880 --> 47:30.320]  at most two k of them can be connected to some vertex in S union T and you will get at least k\n",
      "[47:30.320 --> 47:40.240]  of them, some k of them here that are only connected to the yellow vertex. And so now basically,\n",
      "[47:40.240 --> 47:44.720]  instead of using a buffer inside H, we have just found a buffer inside J.\n",
      "[47:46.480 --> 47:52.640]  And we can use the same strategy. We can jump all the tokens here, starting of course by the yellow\n",
      "[47:52.640 --> 47:56.080]  token and then jump them to where they need to go.\n",
      "[47:56.160 --> 48:13.440]  So now combining those two observations together, if you will, we get the following theorem.\n",
      "[48:13.440 --> 48:20.320]  So if H is alpha sparse and J is C3, C4, free, then the problem admits a kernel on this\n",
      "[48:20.320 --> 48:26.400]  maneuver to C's. And it's basically a simple application of the previous two lemmas. If we have\n",
      "[48:26.400 --> 48:32.480]  more than this maneuver to C's in H, it's a trivial yes instance. If J has a vertex of\n",
      "[48:32.480 --> 48:38.800]  degree 3k or more, it's trivial yes instance. And now you combine all of this together. We know that\n",
      "[48:38.800 --> 48:45.280]  S union T is of size at most 2k. We know that the neighborhood of S union T is of size at most\n",
      "[48:45.280 --> 48:52.160]  2k times 3k, which is roughly 6k squared. And now we know that the rest of the graph has at most\n",
      "[48:52.160 --> 48:58.160]  that maneuver to C's. So basically, you sum up those numbers and you get this bound.\n",
      "[49:06.480 --> 49:12.240]  All right. So how does this theorem imply the result that I promised you to start with?\n",
      "[49:15.440 --> 49:22.000]  So that token jumping and token sliding admit kernel with order k squared vertices.\n",
      "[49:23.360 --> 49:29.440]  I mean, I mean, it also holds for bipartite C4 free graphs, right? Obviously because they are C3C4 free.\n",
      "[49:30.240 --> 49:37.840]  So how do you get the kernel? Well, we know that J cannot contain more than 6k squared minus 2\n",
      "[49:37.840 --> 49:48.640]  k vertices. And we know from a theorem from another paper that C3 free graphs with k squared\n",
      "[49:48.640 --> 49:54.880]  over log k vertices must have an independent set of size at least k. And now we know that if H\n",
      "[49:54.880 --> 49:58.640]  contains more than this maneuver to C's, then we will get the yes instance as well.\n",
      "[50:00.880 --> 50:06.640]  Right. So it becomes an immediate consequence of the previous theorem. But the previous theorem\n",
      "[50:06.640 --> 50:12.560]  is even more general than this corollary. So this corollary does not really use the full power of this theorem.\n",
      "[50:16.400 --> 50:23.200]  All right. That's it. I think I'm fine. If you have questions, I will take them now.\n",
      "[50:23.200 --> 50:35.120]  So it was 55 minutes, right? For the talk. I did not go under the talk.\n",
      "[50:35.120 --> 50:39.120]  It's fine. We usually allow plus minus 10 minutes. That's all right.\n",
      "[50:42.400 --> 50:45.920]  So I have a question about token sliding. Yes.\n",
      "[50:46.880 --> 50:54.320]  So how crucial what happens if one does not restrict the independent sets during the configuration\n",
      "[50:55.440 --> 51:02.560]  to be not of the same size? Is that is that very critical for the difficulty or the easiness of the problem?\n",
      "[51:03.680 --> 51:08.560]  Well, you have to be careful how you define that because in token sliding,\n",
      "[51:09.520 --> 51:15.680]  tokens cannot leave the graph. That's correct. But the independent set sequence\n",
      "[51:15.680 --> 51:18.320]  all the independent sets have to be the same size, right?\n",
      "[51:18.320 --> 51:24.080]  Or if not some token disappeared at some point and I'm not sure how it disappeared.\n",
      "[51:26.400 --> 51:31.680]  Right. Because you start with something of size K and you're going to something of size K,\n",
      "[51:31.680 --> 51:40.080]  you cannot leave the graph unless you define it in some way. So you will remain of size K throughout.\n",
      "[51:41.040 --> 51:46.080]  But you can become slightly larger in K. But where does the new token come from?\n",
      "[51:49.040 --> 51:55.120]  So there is a third rule that I did not tell you about which is called token addition and remove.\n",
      "[51:56.960 --> 52:03.520]  Under that rule, we actually allow you to remove vertices and adversities as long as you remain\n",
      "[52:03.600 --> 52:12.240]  an independent set of size at least K. Does that answer your question?\n",
      "[52:12.240 --> 52:19.200]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. But in fact, it was shown that it was shown that\n",
      "[52:20.720 --> 52:23.680]  so addition and removal is equivalent to token jumping.\n",
      "[52:25.920 --> 52:30.560]  It doesn't it never makes sense to add more tokens to your graph if you don't need them.\n",
      "[52:34.400 --> 52:37.360]  You're only making your life harder into it and be speaking.\n",
      "[52:41.120 --> 52:43.840]  So the other question that I had is I mean I heard I\n",
      "[52:46.720 --> 52:54.640]  so is it possible to view this whole problem on an exponential size graph where every vertex\n",
      "[52:55.280 --> 52:59.680]  corresponds to a independent set in the original graph.\n",
      "[53:00.640 --> 53:06.640]  And then you have edges between two vertices if there is an edge between two vertices of the\n",
      "[53:06.640 --> 53:13.280]  independent set. And now you are doing a reachability question. Is that a meaningful way to think about\n",
      "[53:13.280 --> 53:20.240]  this? But that's exactly what we're doing. But so the way you define your adjacency, I think. So you\n",
      "[53:20.240 --> 53:25.760]  mean you define you make two independent sets adjacent if one can be reached from the other via a\n",
      "[53:25.760 --> 53:30.480]  single slide or a single joint. Exactly. Yeah, one edge here. There is one pair you and me,\n",
      "[53:30.480 --> 53:35.440]  which is adjacent. But that's but that's exactly what we're doing. Okay, okay. Yeah.\n",
      "[53:36.000 --> 53:42.560]  Right? I mean if you because we're looking at algorithms here, we kind of forget the structural\n",
      "[53:42.560 --> 53:47.520]  picture behind it. But this algorithm is finding a path in this graph that you're describing.\n",
      "[53:48.720 --> 53:54.800]  Yeah, yeah, that's it. And what we're saying is you can do it in FBT time or not depending on the\n",
      "[53:54.800 --> 54:13.360]  problem we're talking about. Hi Amir. Hi Amir. Hi. Hi. Hi. Yeah. I'm good. So I had a question. So\n",
      "[54:14.160 --> 54:21.280]  do problems remain equally hard if we bound the if we have a restriction on the number of times,\n",
      "[54:21.280 --> 54:30.720]  we can move the token to a particular vertex. The number of times you can move a token to a\n",
      "[54:30.720 --> 54:36.400]  particular vertex. Like, there's a lot of times the tokens can be moved to a vertex.\n",
      "[54:38.400 --> 54:45.040]  Well, that's definitely going to change the complexity in at least intuitively speaking, right? Because\n",
      "[54:46.000 --> 54:51.040]  now you're saying maybe it will, if you're bounding that by a constant, then you might be saying that\n",
      "[54:51.600 --> 54:58.640]  I'm not allowing exponentially large sequences anymore. But in terms of exactly how the complexity\n",
      "[54:58.640 --> 55:06.480]  changes, I don't have answers. I think it's a very nice question to pose. Even in terms of\n",
      "[55:06.480 --> 55:11.200]  a non-parameterized complexity standard complexity, I think that that would be a very interesting\n",
      "[55:11.200 --> 55:17.360]  question because because it will definitely affect the behavior. I'm not sure exactly how yet.\n",
      "[55:18.320 --> 55:22.640]  I don't know of any results that ask this particular question.\n",
      "[55:23.760 --> 55:30.320]  Okay. So I had one more question in the W. Harnes result that you presented. So do you know\n",
      "[55:30.320 --> 55:38.720]  what is the length of the the length of the changes? Actually, the number of changes or flips that\n",
      "[55:38.720 --> 55:46.880]  you make in your independence? This is just yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. We do. So here, the number of\n",
      "[55:46.880 --> 55:51.200]  changes is going to be where it's basically going to be the shortest possible sequence.\n",
      "[55:53.040 --> 55:59.840]  So it's going to be, so if you think about the simple construction, this one,\n",
      "[56:04.000 --> 56:09.440]  it's basically literally going to be these guys are going to move here. So H is going to cost me\n",
      "[56:09.440 --> 56:16.000]  one slide and then they're all going to and now this guy is going to move here and now I will\n",
      "[56:16.000 --> 56:22.640]  pay one slide for each one here. Now this is the simplified version of it. Once you go to the complete\n",
      "[56:22.640 --> 56:27.680]  version of it, you have some extra slides within the path, but you can also count those.\n",
      "[56:29.440 --> 56:37.920]  Okay. So, but does this mean that so does this mean that at a particular vertex we are placing\n",
      "[56:38.000 --> 56:48.320]  the token at most once? In this case, yes. Okay. In this case, yes. Okay. So this problem should be hard\n",
      "[56:48.320 --> 56:57.520]  even if we bound the number of times tokens can be moved to our vertex, right? Yes. Okay.\n",
      "[56:57.520 --> 57:02.720]  Yes. So here in this case, yes. Absolutely. Okay. Thanks.\n",
      "[57:03.440 --> 57:13.360]  So, Akansha, I have a remark about your question. So if a vertex cannot get a token to I's,\n",
      "[57:14.000 --> 57:18.080]  then it somehow seems to be selecting disjoint independent sets.\n",
      "[57:20.800 --> 57:25.760]  A sequence of them and that may have some bearing on coloring. Just a top level top.\n",
      "[57:25.920 --> 57:35.520]  Okay. So actually for the list, the W hardness case that I'm going to present it, it is exactly\n",
      "[57:35.520 --> 57:41.360]  the case, right? So we are not allowed to move the token like twice on the same vertex.\n",
      "[57:43.280 --> 57:49.360]  Yeah. So I didn't get your point of being so getting this disjoint independence, it's actually\n",
      "[57:50.080 --> 57:56.000]  because if you think of it from the way I thought about it, right, that you are actually trying to find\n",
      "[57:56.000 --> 58:01.680]  a path in a large graph where every vertex corresponds to an independent set and you move from one\n",
      "[58:01.680 --> 58:10.960]  independent set to another. But we can only move from one independent set to the other if the change\n",
      "[58:10.960 --> 58:24.400]  is like in case of tokens sliding, it's one probably. Yeah. So it looks to be that you're asking for\n",
      "[58:26.160 --> 58:32.560]  a collection of independent sets which are vertex disjoint. If the token sequence of independence\n",
      "[58:32.560 --> 58:39.600]  sets which are vertex disjoint. So if I may, I think I think Akansha's question would be more\n",
      "[58:39.600 --> 58:46.080]  relevant in a place where we don't have a monotone sequence, meaning a sequence. So we need a\n",
      "[58:46.080 --> 58:51.920]  version of the problem or some cases of the problem where a vertex has to be visited multiple times\n",
      "[58:53.520 --> 58:59.040]  to find solutions. And that is known to be the case for some versions or some statements of the\n",
      "[58:59.040 --> 59:05.760]  problem. And in fact, Akansha, so this was the crucial difference between piece-based completeness\n",
      "[59:05.760 --> 59:12.480]  and NP completeness of sliding versus jumping in bipartite graphs. So it was because we were\n",
      "[59:12.480 --> 59:19.760]  able to show that no vertex will be visited more than once. Okay. And the other problem. So that's\n",
      "[59:19.760 --> 59:24.560]  why it's definitely an interesting question to pose, but you have to be careful in what context you\n",
      "[59:24.560 --> 59:35.520]  pose it. Great. I don't know if that kind of settles, answers your question. Yes, yes, it does.\n",
      "[59:36.080 --> 59:39.120]  All right. Thanks. You're welcome.\n",
      "[59:46.960 --> 59:54.320]  Any more questions?\n",
      "[01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:26.480]  I guess not. Yeah, I don't think that I know more questions. I will just once again announce the\n",
      "[01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:32.320]  parameterized and go to the 301 workshop, which is going to happen in December in the link has been\n",
      "[01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:38.560]  posted once again in the chat. Some advanced topics in parameterized complexity will be discussed.\n",
      "[01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:46.720]  Those interested can have a look and register for it. And yeah, if there are some more questions,\n",
